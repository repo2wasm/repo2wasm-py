# Limitations

Web browsers execute the [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) (Wasm) bytecode in a sandboxed environment separated from the host. The sandboxed environment has some limitations, including

- maximum of 4 GB because of the use of 32-bit indexes.
- multithreading is still being standardized and implemented by browsers. 
- [single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) is still being standardized and implemented by browsers.
- can **only** escape the sandbox going through appropriate APIs.
