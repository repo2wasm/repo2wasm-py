# repo2wasm-py

`repo2wasm` is a clone of [`jupyter-repo2docker`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker) targeting [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) (Wasm) environment.

This is a implementation of `repo2wasm` in Python. At the moment, it is a wrap around [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/). In the future, we expect to add support to [webR REPL](https://webr.sh/).
